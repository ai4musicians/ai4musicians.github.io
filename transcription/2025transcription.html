                    <h2> Summary</h2>

                    <p> A competition of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) will be
                        held in April 2025. In this competition, participants submit
                        computer programs that can convert audio recordings of classical
                        styles to Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). A submitted
                        computer program has up to 10 minutes to convert 100 recordings;
                        each recording may be up to 20 seconds long and may contain at
                        most three musical instruments. The rank of the submissions will
                        consider multiple factors, including correct instruments, pitches,
                        onset, offset, and dynamics. Most of the audio will be produced by
                        using synthesized sound; a small percentage will be recorded from
                        human performance. </p>

                    <p> Contestants will register on the website of
                        https://ai4musicians.org/. Sample music (including the scores and
                        the audio recordings) will be provided on the website. Contestants
                        can use any data for training their programs. Submissions will be
                        open in March 2025. The programs submitted to the website will run
                        on a computer equipped with GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) in
                        Purdue's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing
                        (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/). Each team can submit at most once
                        every 24 hours. A leaderboard will show the rank of the teams
                        running the sample data. An additional set of holdout data will be
                        used to determine the final rank and awards. A sample (open-source)
                        solution will be available for contestants to study the input and
                        output formats. If a submitted solution is inferior to the sample
                        solution, the submitted solution is disqualified for consideration
                        of an award. Winners will be invited to present their solutions at a
                        conference (TBD).

                    <h2> For Contributing Composers </h2>

                    <p>
                        For the 2025 challenge, the composers are by invitation by the
                        organizers only. The reason is that the organizers wish to manage the
                        difficulty of the music so that computer programs can provide
                        meaningful results. If a composer is interested in contributing,
                        please contact the organizers. The composers will retain their
                        copyright. Composers will agree to provide their music royalty-free
                        and non-exclusive rights to the challenge organizers for the purpose
                        of this automatic music transcription challenge, including (but not
                        limited to) redistributing the music as samples and analyzing the
                        music by computer programs. The organizers may modify the music from
                        the composers to meet the restrictions of the scoring program. The
                        names, profile photos, and links to the composers' websites will be
                        listed on the https://ai4musicians.org/ website if a composer is
                        selected by the organizers. </p>

                    <p>
                        A composer will provide at least 10 and at most 30 pieces of
                        music. Each piece is approximately 20 seconds long. These numbers aim
                        to give each composer a reasonable representation without causing
                        computer programs to "overfit" into a specific composer's style. Each
                        piece is between 10 and 20 seconds. The music should be divided into 3
                        levels of difficulties: easy, medium, and difficult. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Tempo range from 60 bpm-90 bpm </li>
                        <li> Pitch range should be from C2 to C7 </li>

                        <li> The smallest rhythmic duration should be sixteenth-notes or
                            sixteenth-rests </li>

                        <li> No interpreted rhythms such as swing feel patterns (must ne
                            clearly discernable without interpretation)

                            If desiring a swing pattern, write as dotted eighth and
                            sixteenth-note or quarter-note/eight-note triplets </li>

                        <li> No doubly-dotted notes </li>

                        <li> Can be rhythmically and melodically diverse </li>

                        <li> Stay within the following meters: 3/4, 4/4, 6/8. </li>

                        <li> Keep the dynamic range from pianissimo to fortissimo (pp, p,
                            mp, mf, f, ff) </li>

                        <li> Tonal, modal and atonal styles, or a blend of these, are all
                            encouraged </li>

                        <li> Up to three different instruments may be used in each
                            composition. If piano is included in the instrumentation, keep the
                            composition as a duet (piano and some other instrument). Avoid
                            using violin and cello in combination with each other, due to
                            their common timbral characteristics. When writing for multiple
                            instruments (limit of 3), use a diversity of timbre combinations
                            such as flute and trumpet, flute, violin and clarinet, or violin
                            flute, cello and bassoon. Any combination of instruments is fine
                            as long as the timbre of each is clearly discernable. </li>

                        <li> Submit a score and MIDI Mp3 recording of each work.

                    </ul>
