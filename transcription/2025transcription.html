                        <p>
                            The 2025 Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) Challenge invites participants to develop
                            computer programs capable of accurately transcribing synthesized audio recordings of
                            classical music into Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files. Each submission will
                            process 100 recordings, each up to 20 seconds long, within a maximum time limit of 4 hours.
                            The audio data has been synthesized to sound as realistic as possible, closely resembling
                            natural instrumental performances. Unlike previous challenges, participants will be informed
                            of the specific instruments present in each recording. While utilizing this information is
                            optional, incorrect instrument identification will incur a penalty, with smaller penalties
                            applied if the mistake involves similar instrument families. Evaluation criteria include the
                            accuracy of instrument identification, pitch, onset, offset, and dynamics.

                        <p>
                            Participants will register on the official website
                            <a href="https://ai4musicians.org/">ai4musicians.org</a>, where sample music files,
                            including scores and audio recordings, will be provided to assist in model development.
                            Contestants may use any public or proprietary data for training their models. Submissions
                            will be open in April 2025, and each team's program will be executed on a GPU-equipped
                            system at Purdue's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Teams may submit their models once every 24 hours, and a live leaderboard will display
                            performance results based on the sample data. Final rankings will be determined using an
                            additional set of holdout data. A sample open-source solution will be made available to
                            demonstrate input and output formats. Models performing worse than the sample will not be
                            eligible for awards. Winning teams will be invited to present their solutions at the 2025
                            IEEE ICME Conference.

                        <h2>Submission Details</h2>
                        <p>
                            Participants who have registered for the competition must follow these guidelines for
                            submitting their models:
                        </p>
                        <h3>Repository Access</h3>
                        <p>
                            During registration, participants are required to provide a link to their code repository
                            along with a fine-grained access token. This token is necessary for the competition backend
                            to pull the model for execution.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Submission Branch</h3>
                        <p>
                            To submit a model, participants must create a branch titled <code>submission</code> in their
                            repository. The competition backend will automatically pull from this branch to run the
                            model.
                        </p>
                        <p>Submissions are validated if the following conditions are met:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The branch titled <code>submission</code> exists.</li>
                            <li>New commits have been made to the branch since the last successful run.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Environment Configuration</h3>
                        <p>
                            Participants must include an <code>environment.yml</code> file in the root directory of
                            their GitHub repository. This file will be used to create a conda environment during the
                            model execution. Please ensure that the environment file correctly specifies all
                            dependencies and versions required to run the model.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Model Execution Requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            To run the model, the repository must contain a file named <code>main.py</code> located in
                            the root directory. This script must accept the following command-line arguments:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>-i</code>: Path to the input audio file (in .mp3 format).</li>
                            <li><code>-o</code>: Path to save the output MIDI file.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Example usage:</p>
                        <pre><code>python main.py -i input.mp3 -o output.midi</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            All paths and directories referenced in the <code>main.py</code> file should be relative to
                            its own location. This ensures compatibility with the backend environment.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Submission Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            As long as the submission branch exists and new commits are detected, the system will
                            automatically run the model. The backend will handle the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pulling the latest code from the <code>submission</code> branch.</li>
                            <li>Creating a conda environment using the provided <code>environment.yml</code> file.</li>
                            <li>Executing the model using the specified command.</li>
                            <li>Sending email notifications to the participant, including:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Status updates on the model run.</li>
                                <li>Input and output of the model.</li>
                                <li>Performance statistics of the model.</li>
                                <li>
                                    The SLURM job output, allowing the participant to verify that the backend
                                    successfully processed their model.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Model Weights</h3>
                        <p>
                            Participants may use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for managing model weights within their
                            repository. The backend supports Git LFS, so there are no restrictions on using large files.

                        <p>
                            As a reference implementation, we present <strong>MT3</strong> (Multi-Task Multitrack Music
                            Transcription) developed by Google's Magenta team. MT3 is a state-of-the-art model designed
                            to transcribe music involving multiple instruments simultaneously. It utilizes a
                            Transformer-based architecture to process audio inputs and generate corresponding musical
                            notations.

                            Participants are encouraged to study MT3 as a foundational model to gain insights into
                            effective music transcription architectures. It serves as a valuable starting point for
                            developing and refining your own transcription models.

                            <strong>Note:</strong> To be considered for a winning submission, your model must achieve a
                            higher transcription accuracy score compared to MT3. This benchmark ensures that new models
                            contribute meaningful advancements to the field of music transcription.

                        <h2>For Contributing Composers</h2>

                        <p>
                            For the 2025 challenge, the composers are by invitation by the organizers only. The reason
                            is that the organizers wish to manage the difficulty of the music so that computer programs
                            can provide meaningful results. If a composer is interested in contributing, please contact
                            the organizers. The composers will retain their copyright. Composers will agree to provide
                            their music royalty-free and non-exclusive rights to the challenge organizers for the
                            purpose of this automatic music transcription challenge, including (but not limited to)
                            redistributing the music as samples and analyzing the music by computer programs. The
                            organizers may modify the music from the composers to meet the restrictions of the scoring
                            program. The names, profile photos, and links to the composers' websites will be listed on
                            the https://ai4musicians.org/ website if a composer is selected by the organizers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A composer will provide at least 10 and at most 30 pieces of music. Each piece is
                            approximately 20 seconds long. These numbers aim to give each composer a reasonable
                            representation without causing computer programs to "overfit" into a specific composer's
                            style. Each piece is between 10 and 20 seconds. The music should be divided into 3 levels of
                            difficulties: easy, medium, and difficult.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Tempo range from 60 bpm-90 bpm</li>
                            <li>Pitch range should be from C2 to C7</li>

                            <li>The smallest rhythmic duration should be sixteenth-notes or sixteenth-rests</li>

                            <li>
                                No interpreted rhythms such as swing feel patterns (must ne clearly discernable without
                                interpretation) If desiring a swing pattern, write as dotted eighth and sixteenth-note
                                or quarter-note/eight-note triplets
                            </li>

                            <li>No doubly-dotted notes</li>

                            <li>Can be rhythmically and melodically diverse</li>

                            <li>Stay within the following meters: 3/4, 4/4, 6/8.</li>

                            <li>No trills or mordents of any type.</li>

                            <li>Keep the dynamic range from pianissimo to fortissimo (pp, p, mp, mf, f, ff)</li>

                            <li>Tonal, modal and atonal styles, or a blend of these, are all encouraged</li>

                            <li>
                                Up to three different instruments may be used in each composition. Avoid using violin
                                and cello in combination with each other, due to their common timbral characteristics.
                                When writing for multiple instruments (limit of 3), use a diversity of timbre
                                combinations such as (1) flute and trombone, (2) violin and bassoon, (3) cello, oboe,
                                and bassoon. Any combination of instruments is fine as long as the timbre of each is
                                clearly discernable.
                            </li>

                            <li>Submit a score (PDF), MusicXML, and MIDI recording of each work.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>List of Instruments</h3>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Piano</li>
                            <li>Violin</li>

                            The instrument groups should not include instruments that can be misclassified easily even
                            by human experts (e.g., violin and viola).
