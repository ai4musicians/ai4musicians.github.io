						<h2>An Online Competition</h2>
						<h2>Summary</h2>

						<p>
							A competition of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) will be held
							in April 2025. In this competition, participants submit computer
							programs that can convert audio recordings of classical styles to
							Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). A submitted computer
							program has up to 10 minutes to convert 100 recordings; each
							recording may be up to 20 seconds long and may contain at most
							three musical instruments. The rank of the submissions will
							consider multiple factors, including correct instruments, pitches,
							onset, offset, and dynamics. Most of the audio will be produced by
							using synthesized sound; a small percentage will be recorded from
							human performance.

						<h2>Technical Details</h2>

						<p>
							Contestants will register on the website of
							https://ai4musicians.org/. Sample music (including the scores and
							the audio recordings) will be provided on the website. Contestants
							can use any data for training their programs. Submissions will be
							open in March 2025. The programs submitted to the website will run
							on a computer equipped with GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) in
							Purdue's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing
							(https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/). Each team can submit at most once
							every 24 hours. A leaderboard will show the rank of the teams
							running the sample data. An additional set of holdout data will be
							used to determine the final rank and awards. A sample
							(open-source) solution will be available for contestants to study
							the input and output formats. If a submitted solution is inferior
							to the sample solution, the submitted solution is disqualified for
							consideration of an award. Winners will be invited to present
							their solutions at <a href="https://2025.ieeeicme.org/">2025 ICME</a>
						</p>

						<h2>For Contributing Composers</h2>

						<p>
							For the 2025 challenge, the composers are by invitation by the
							organizers only. The reason is that the organizers wish to manage
							the difficulty of the music so that computer programs can provide
							meaningful results. If a composer is interested in contributing,
							please contact the organizers. The composers will retain their
							copyright. Composers will agree to provide their music
							royalty-free and non-exclusive rights to the challenge organizers
							for the purpose of this automatic music transcription challenge,
							including (but not limited to) redistributing the music as samples
							and analyzing the music by computer programs. The organizers may
							modify the music from the composers to meet the restrictions of
							the scoring program. The names, profile photos, and links to the
							composers' websites will be listed on the
							https://ai4musicians.org/ website if a composer is selected by the
							organizers.
						</p>

						<p>
							A composer will provide at least 10 and at most 30 pieces of
							music. Each piece is approximately 20 seconds long. These numbers
							aim to give each composer a reasonable representation without
							causing computer programs to "overfit" into a specific composer's
							style. Each piece is between 10 and 20 seconds. The music should
							be divided into 3 levels of difficulties: easy, medium, and
							difficult.
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Tempo range from 60 bpm-90 bpm</li>
							<li>Pitch range should be from C2 to C7</li>

							<li>
								The smallest rhythmic duration should be sixteenth-notes or
								sixteenth-rests
							</li>

							<li>
								No interpreted rhythms such as swing feel patterns (must ne
								clearly discernable without interpretation) If desiring a swing
								pattern, write as dotted eighth and sixteenth-note or
								quarter-note/eight-note triplets
							</li>

							<li>No doubly-dotted notes</li>

							<li>Can be rhythmically and melodically diverse</li>

							<li>Stay within the following meters: 3/4, 4/4, 6/8.</li>

							<li>
								Keep the dynamic range from pianissimo to fortissimo (pp, p, mp,
								mf, f, ff)
							</li>

							<li>
								Tonal, modal and atonal styles, or a blend of these, are all
								encouraged
							</li>

							<li>
								Up to three different instruments may be used in each
								composition. If piano is included in the instrumentation, keep
								the composition as a duet (piano and some other instrument).
								Avoid using violin and cello in combination with each other, due
								to their common timbral characteristics. When writing for
								multiple instruments (limit of 3), use a diversity of timbre
								combinations such as (1) flute and trombone, (2) violin and
								bassoon, (3) cello, oboe, and bassoon. Any combination of
								instruments is fine as long as the timbre of each is clearly
								discernable.
							</li>

							<li>
								Submit a score (PDF), MusicXML, and MIDI recording of each work.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>List of Instruments</h3>

							viola).

						<h2>Cash Awards (tentative)</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The top award is up to $1,500 US Dollars.</li>
							<li>The second award is up to $1,000 US Dollars.</li>
							<li>The third award is $500 US Dollars.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							The winners must open source their solutions before receiving the
							cash awards (required in the registration agreement). The source
							code should have proper documentation for reproducibility. The
							organizers will examine the source code before announcing the
							winners. The cash awards can be given to only the participants
							that are not in the embargoed and sanctioned countries declared by
							the United States.
						</p>

						<p>
							The award may be in the form of cash or travel grants that may
							include conference registration + hotel + airplane ticket.

									a set of holdout data that is similar to, but different from,
									the public sample data.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									How can it be possible that No.1 in the leaderboard is not
									No.1 in the final announcement?
								</td>
								<td>
									It is possible if the solution overfits the public data but
									does not generalize well for the holdout data.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Will the organizers provide training data?</td>
								<td>
									The competition will provide sample data, not training data.
									Contestants can use any data (including public and proprietary

								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Can industry participate?</td>
