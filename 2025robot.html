                        <h2>Workshop Summary</h2>
                        <p>
                            This workshop will explore the technologies that can enable robots to play musical
                            instruments. Virtuosity of musical instruments is considered one of the most challenging and
                            elevated forms of human expression. Despite decades of progress in robotics technology,
                            today's robots are still not ready to play musical instruments at the same level as
                            professional musicians. Playing musical instruments requires coordination of movement and
                            precise timing with appropriate amounts of forces. For different instruments, different body
                            parts are required, such as hands, mouth, or feet. The robots must possess fine motor skills
                            coupled with advanced intelligence and can integrate multimodal sensing, real-time response,
                            and correctly articulating musical notes. This workshop will provide a snapshot of the state
                            of the art in robotic technologies for playing musical instruments. The workshop will
                            feature invited speakers that are recognized experts in this field. The authors of selected
                            papers will present their recent work. A panel discussion will explore research directions
                            for the community. The workshop will conclude with a poster session and demonstrations.
