                            professor of Computer Graphics Technology. His research covers interdisciplinary domains of
                            Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction, such as Information Visualization, Visual
                            Analytics, Virtual Reality, and AI in Computer Graphics. He seeks to design, model, and
                            construct new forms of interaction in visualization and system design, by which the system
                            can minimize its influence on design and analysis, and become a true free extension of
                            human's brain and hand.
