		  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		  <p>Imagine that one out of five of your friends cannot enjoy the music you are playing. </p>
		  <p> Playing and listening to music is one of the most universal forms of communication and entertainment across cultures.
		    Unfortunately, nearly 20% of the population are hearing-impaired and they cannot enjoy music.
		    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>

		  <p>
		    This project aims to develop technologies that
		    visualize music for entertainment. The process
		    comprises the following steps: (a) Music is
		    analyzed and classified into multiple dimensions,
		    including instrumentation, emotion, tempo, pitch
		    range, harmony, dynamics, and more. This analysis
		    yields textual descriptions.  (b) The texts form
		    feature matrix and are inputs to machine learning
		    models for classification.  (c) These models
		    predict the genre of the input audio and its
		    associated emotions. These predictions form the
		    basis for text prompts that describe the music.
		    (d) The prompts are fed into generative machine
		    models to create visual representations, such as
		    images or videos.  (e) The visual representations
		    are continuously updated as the music plays,
		    ensuring that the visual effects aptly mirror the
		    musical changes. Variations in the prompts produce
		    different styles of images. Notably, these images
		    and videos are generated without human
		    intervention, significantly reducing costs and
		    time to produce visual representations tailored to
		    the specific piece of music.  This approach is
		    different from video recordings of music
		    performance because recordings can provide only
		    passive watching experience.  In contrast, the
		    proposed solution has the advantage of creating
		    <i>personalized</i> and <i>interactive </i>
		    entertainment experience.  This proposed project
		    will conduct extensive user studies to evaluate
		    whether generative models can effectively produce
		    visual representations of music's rich expression,
		    heralding a novel form of entertainment.
