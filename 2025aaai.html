					<h2>Workshop Summary</h2>
					<p>This workshop will explore the dynamic intersection of artificial intelligence and  music. Music is one of the most common formats of communication, entertainment, and expressions. Producing, understanding, and processing music present many challenges in artificial intelligence. This workshop investigates how AI is changing the music industry and education, from composition to performance, production, collaboration, and audience experience. Participants will gain insights into the technological problems from music and the ways AI can enhance creativity and enable musicians and producers to push the boundaries of their art. The workshop will also discuss AI's impacts on music education and careers of musicians. We will cover topics such as AI-driven music composition, where algorithms generate melodies, harmonies, and even full orchestral arrangements. The workshop will discuss how AI tools can assist in sound design, remixing, and mastering, allowing for new sonic possibilities and efficiencies in music production. Artificial intelligence may provide a rich user experience combining sound and visual effects. Additionally, the workshop will discuss the legal and ethical implications of AI in music, including questions of authorship, originality, and the role of human artists in an increasingly automated world. This workshop is designed for AI researchers, musicians, producers, and educators interested in the status and future of AI for music. .</p>
