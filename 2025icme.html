                        <h2>Workshop Summary</h2>
                        <p>
                            Music is an essential component of multimedia
                            content. This workshop will explore the dynamic
                            intersection of artificial intelligence and music.
                            This workshop investigates how AI is changing the
                            music industry and education, from composition to
                            performance, production, collaboration, and audience
                            experience. Participants will gain insights into the
                            ways AI can enhance creativity and enable musicians
                            and producers to push the boundaries of their art.
                            The workshop will also discuss AI's impacts on music
                            education and the careers of musicians. We will
                            cover topics such as AI-driven music composition,
                            where algorithms generate melodies, harmonies, and
                            even full orchestral arrangements.
                            Computer-generated music may be combined with
                            computer-generated video to create the entire
                            multimedia content. The workshop will discuss how AI
                            tools can assist in sound design, remixing, and
                            mastering, allowing for new sonic possibilities and
                            efficiencies in music production. Additionally, the
                            workshop will discuss the legal and ethical
                            implications of AI in music, including questions of
                            authorship, originality, and the role of the human
                            artist in an increasingly automated world. This
                            workshop is designed for AI researchers, musicians,
                            producers, and educators interested in the status
                            and future of AI in music. The organizing team will
                            hold a competition for Automatic Music Transcription
                            (AMT). This online competition will accept
                            submissions worldwide, including both academia and
                            industry. The winners will present their solutions
                            at this ICME workshop. This competition is sponsored
                            by the IEEE Technical Community on Multimedia
                            Computing (TCMC) and the Computer Society. More
                            details about this challenge will be available

                            This one-day workshop will explore the dynamic
                            intersection of artificial intelligence and
                            multimedia with an emphasis on music and audio
                            technologies. The workshop explores how AI is
                            transforming music creation, recognition, and
                            education, ethical and legal implications, as well
                            as business opportunities. We will investigate how
                            AI is changing the music industry and education—from
                            composition to performance, production,
                            collaboration, and audience experience. Participants
                            will gain insights into the technological challenges
                            in music and how AI can enhance creativity, enabling
                            musicians and producers to push the boundaries of
                            their art. The workshop will cover topics such as
                            AI-driven music composition, where algorithms
                            generate melodies, harmonies, and even full
                            orchestral arrangements. We will discuss how AI

                            efficiencies in music production. Additionally,
                            we'll examine AI's impact on music education and the
                            careers of musicians, exploring advanced learning
                            tools and teaching methods. AI technologies are
                            increasingly adopted in the music and entertainment
                            industry. The workshop will also discuss the legal
                            and ethical implications of AI in music, including
                            questions of authorship, originality, and the
                            evolving role of human artists in an increasingly
                            automated world. This workshop is designed for AI
                            researchers, musicians, producers, and educators
                            interested in the current status and future of AI in
                            music.

                                      <strong>Abstract:</strong>
				      Self-supervised learning aims to apply supervised learning algorithms
				      without the need for annotated data.  It can therefore offer a
				      solution for training ML-based systems in music, a domain where
				      annotated data is often scarce.  In this talk, we review recent
				      advances in self-supervised learning applied to music, focusing on its
				      two main paradigms: invariance (e.g., contrastive, masking,
				      teacher-student, clustering, information-based, multi-modal) and
				      equivariance.  More precisely, we present our contributions: MatPac as
				      foundation models, Stem-JEPA for generation, PESTO for pitch, PESTO-T
				      for tempo, and CPC for beat detection.

                                        synthesis. In the music tech industry,
                                        Javier has worked on diverse projects
                                        involving machine learning (ML) and
                                        music, including recommendation systems,
                                        instrument recognition, and automatic
                                        mixing. He contributed to the

                                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The area of
                                        computational audio analysis -also
                                        called machine listening- continues to
                                        evolve. Starting from methods grounded
                                        in digital signal processing and
                                        acoustics, followed by supervised
                                        machine learning methods that require
                                        large amounts of labelled data, recent
                                        approaches for learning music audio
                                        representations are fueled by advances
                                        in the broader field of artificial
                                        intelligence. The talk will outline
                                        recent research carried out at the
                                        Centre for Digital Music of Queen Mary
                                        University of London focusing on
                                        emerging learning paradigms for making
                                        sense of music and audio data. Topics
                                        covered will include learning in the
                                        presence of limited audio data, the
                                        inclusion of other modalities such as
                                        natural language to aid learning music
                                        representations, and finally methods for
                                        learning from unlabelled audio data -
                                        with the latter being used as a first
                                        step towards the creation of music
                                        foundation models.
