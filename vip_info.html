				<!-- Introduction -->

				<section>
					<h2>Introduction + Purpose of the Team</h2>
					<p> AIM stands out among other music technology research groups because of its pedagogy. While other music technology groups may cater primarily to graduate students and professionals, our group is open to all Purdue students of any major and experience level. </p>
		  			<p> We hope that by helping any student interested in music technology/machine learning learn to work with these technologies, we can make a difference in these students' lives while simultaneously encouraging the adoption of music technology.</p> 
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Interested students</h2>
					<p>Although we try to allow as many students as we have capacity for to join, we do have a requirement that new members are fluent in Python and Numpy (or can pick it up within a week or two of joining). Learning introductory coding, while important, would be almost impossible while also balancing research duties on the team.
						<br>Pretty much every other skill can be learned while on the team, although some skills take more dedication and effort to learn than others.

					<p>Below you can find a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTB7ZLT4CNdjF5E-sNophr7dWsP30Vypj6752FoC5zmAVj_3GulEg5HffDbSJF1aiee0gIJM9XIJYbI/pub">Google Doc</a> containing some information about the current VIP projects.</p>

					<h3>Projects + thesis capability</h3>
					<p>Almost all AIM students choose one of the following projects to work on (see the doc below). However, if you have an idea for a scope extension to a project or would like to complete a thesis/paper on a project, please reach out to the contacts below. We'd love to hear your ideas!</p>
